bot for coretop, wow!!!

gets levels & players, adds levels & victors, deletes levels, has a guessing game, and more (im lazy to list it out :3)

the api its calling for levels n stuff isnt currently online and is on localhost, but thats probably going to change soon

the requirements are in requirements.txt
its also needed to install gifski and add a path variable to the directory containing the binary

dont expect this to be good code lmao, i suck

thanks
